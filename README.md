# Task_06_Deep_Fake

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my submission for **Research Task 6: Deep Fake**.  
The objective was to take the narrative from **Task 5 (Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse 2024–2025 stats)** and transform it into a simulated **AI-generated interview** between a host and an analyst.  

The focus of this task is less on the polished final product and more on the **process**: experimenting with free AI tools, structuring workflow, and documenting challenges and workarounds.

## 🎬 Deliverables
- **Video** → [`video.mp4`](video.mp4)  
- **Script** → [`script.md`](script.md)  
---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **HeyGen (Quick Avatar Video)** → to generate avatars and assign dialogue.  
- **Windows Screen Recorder (Win + Alt + R)** → to capture the conversation playback.  
- **GitHub** → for version control and organizing outputs.

---

## ⚠️ Key Issue & Workaround
- **Issue:** HeyGen’s fully interactive two-speaker export is only available with a paid plan.  
- **Workaround:** I created the interview using two avatars and alternating dialogue scenes, then **screen-recorded the playback** to produce the final video.  
- **Reason:** This follows the assignment guideline to rely on **free/student resources** and to focus on documenting process over product.

## 📄 Workflow
1. Drafted a Q&A script based on Task 5 analysis.  
2. Opened HeyGen → Quick Avatar Video → added two avatars (host + analyst).  
3. Pasted alternating dialogue into scenes.  
4. Screen-recorded the video since the export feature was locked.  
5. Organized outputs into this repo (script, prompts, video, screenshots, documentation).

## 🔑 Skills Practiced
- Data storytelling (turning statistics into narrative dialogue)  
- AI/ML tool use (avatars, TTS)  
- Workflow design & documentation  
- Version control with GitHub  
- Reflection on limitations and ethical considerations of deepfake media

2. Select **two avatars**.  
3. Paste dialogue from `script.md'  
4. Preview the conversation.  
5. Use a free screen recorder (Windows/Mac) to capture playback.

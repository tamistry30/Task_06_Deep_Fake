# Task_06_Deep_Fake

## Overview
This project converts my Task 5 narrative on Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse (2024 vs 2025) into an AI-generated interview (host + analyst). Deliverables include the final video, script, prompts, and a process log emphasizing workflow and tool choices (as requested).:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Final Deliverable
- **Video:** `video/final_interview.mp4` (screen recording of the conversation)
- **Script:** `script/interview_script.md`
- **Prompts:** `prompts/heygen_prompt.txt`, `prompts/tts_prompts.txt` (if used)
- **Process log:** `process/process_log.md`

## Tools Tried
- **HeyGen** (avatar video)
- (Optional) **ElevenLabs / Edge Read Aloud** (TTS)
- **Screen recorder:** Windows Game Bar / OBS / QuickTime

## Key Issue & Workaround (Important)
- **Issue:** HeyGen’s fully interactive “multi-speaker” conversation requires a **paid** plan.
- **Workaround used:** I configured two avatars and **screen-recorded** the alternating dialogue to produce a continuous interview. This preserves interactivity without incurring costs, consistent with the instruction to use **free/student resources**.:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Workflow
1. Drafted a concise Q&A script from Task 5 results.
2. Set up two avatars in HeyGen; pasted dialogue with speaker labels.
3. Previewed, adjusted pacing/pronunciations (e.g., “Syracuse” → *SIR-uh-kyooz*).
4. **Screen-recorded** the conversation playback (due to paywall).
5. Exported MP4 and organized repo (script, prompts, video, screenshots).
6. Reflected on tool tradeoffs and ethics of synthetic media.

## Ethics & Notes
- Disclosed AI generation and limitations.
- Used only publicly available/student-tier tools (no spend).:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## How to Reproduce (Free Path)
- Open HeyGen → Quick Avatar Video → add two avatars.
- Paste `prompts/heygen_prompt.txt` line-by-line into alternating scenes.
- Use a free screen recorder to capture playback.
- (Optional) Replace voices via free TTS and upload audio as “voiceover.”

## Attribution
- Dataset & analysis stem from my Task 5 work.
